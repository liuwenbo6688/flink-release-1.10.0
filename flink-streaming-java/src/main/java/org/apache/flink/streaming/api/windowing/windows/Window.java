 * A {@code Window} is a grouping of elements into finite buckets. Windows have a maximum timestamp
 * which means that, at some point, all elements that go into one window will have arrived.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses should implement {@code equals()} and {@code hashCode()} so that logically
 * same windows are treated the same.
 *
 * Window在这里可理解为元素的一种分组方式
 * Window为一个抽象类，其中仅定义了一个方法 maxTimestamp()，其意义为该window时间跨度所能包含的最大时间点（用时间戳表示）
 *
 * Window类包含两个子类：GlobalWindow和TimeWindow
 * GlobalWindow是全局窗口
 * TimeWindow是具有起止时间的时间段窗口。
